I'm a second-year MS Computer Scientist at Arizona State University working in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) under the supervision of Dr. Hua Wei. I'm broadly interested in Reinforcement Learning with a particular interest in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. My current research is focused on different aspects of MARL, but primarily centers around improving transfer to real-world applications.
